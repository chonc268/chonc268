      <p>Much like two sides of a coin, print and the digital coexist to create a narrative of the world we live in today. Thus, I wish to explore the digital side of my thesis "DOT" on a more intricate level as the next step to my project. This led me to emulate the versatility of the modern dot, the "PIXEL".  The digital property allows for viewer interaction that print does not, expanding to new horizons beyond the capabilities of print. Through the "PIXEL", I plan to uncover the hidden potential of the "DOT" when it is brought to a new plane.</p>
