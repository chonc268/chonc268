  <h1><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/56208">Moon Missing</a></h1>
  <h2>BY ALLAN PETERSON</h2>
  <p>I was so worried the hickory I recognized<br/>
    had died from salt burn in the last hurricane<br/>
    I may have passed by vervain and apple haw<br/>
    like they didn’t matter, but this spring<br/>
    it put out seven shoots from its base.<br/>
    Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,<br/>
    then the “new” moon appears,<br/>
    though we know it’s the old one, and we pretend<br/>
    to be taken in like the mother or baby<br/>
    behind the bath towel.<br/>
    Really it’s the moon winking,<br/>
    being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.<br/>
    And when I tell Frances, I see she is a moon<br/>
    motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting<br/>
    a lamp, a face that awakens on paper.</p>
